            <p>When you as an entrepreneur think about branding, the very first thing that comes to your mind is a Logo. One of the main things that make your brand memorable is to possess an impressive logo, which along with your company's name', gives your brand an edge. It is like naming a baby when it's just born as the baby is going to carry the name with him or her all his life. Think of eBay, Google, and Yahoo. When it comes to logo design, it’s easy to get mired down in the details. What color combination will look good? Is this font sending the right brand message?

            <p>But before you get stuck in all the little things that make up the physical components of a design, you need to think about the intangible qualities that make up a logo. These are things you can’t touch or see, but they help convey the brand message.
                Of course, knowing what makes a good logo is only half the battle. The other half is figuring out how to mix all of those elements into one coherent design.
            </p>
            <p>A logo is a critical and most important aspect of marketing any business or brand. As a graphical representation, it anchors a company's brand and becomes the single most visible manifestation of the company within the target market. Thus, a fine-designed logo is an essential part of any company's overall marketing strategy.
            </p>
            <h4>You should consider the following aspects while developing your logo to create a long lasting impression on the market. </h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It needs to be SIMPLE so that they are easy to recognize. Example- Nike, Apple, Dell, etc.</li>
                    <li>It needs to be RELEVANT to the company profile. It should depict the brand essence.</li>
                    <li>It needs to be MEMORABLE. The design should be such that it creates an impression at first sight. The font, colors & style play a major role. </li>
                    <li>It needs to be UNIQUE including the name. The Entrepreneur does not realize the value of the Trade Mark, Registration. Such things need to be considered at the prenatal stage. </li>
                    <li>It must be ENTICING. It should appeal to the target audience.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>With time, companies do go undergo subtle changes in their existing logos according to the existing market need, the mood of the company & the mindset of the business owner.
                <br>
                Many logos are designed on the cheap, with little thought given to them. Other companies like Macintosh, Xerox, and Lucent spent upwards of half a million dollars each to develop their logos. Then countless millions more to promote them. What they got for their money are symbols that are recognized instantly, around the world. You don’t even need to see a name – the symbol is enough.
