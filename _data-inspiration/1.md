            <h3>The challenge.</h3>
            <p class="big-text">
                SKF faced major challenges in terms of safeguarding their identity. The faced cases where traders have misused SKF's AID (Authorized Industrial Distributor) certificate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AID was forged or copied regular text information and further misused. QR code forging was also witnessed. It was difficult to maintain security amongst the traders. They realized a need for additional security, something that will secure their trades.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Unauthorized breakthroughs needed to be avoided. To restrict the misuse of these certificates it was necessary to step up to an advanced level of security.

                Considering all the challenges they were facing we took into consideration their concerns and worked on unique QR codes. Each code we generated unique ID which cannot be copied or generated on any other device. Ã‚ A lot of research and dedicated efforts help us overcoming this challenge.
